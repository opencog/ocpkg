## Collection of scripts

#### ocpkg
* It is a script to install an OpenCog development environment on a fresh installation of Ubuntu >= 14.04 . It has options to selectively download, build, test, install and package OpenCog projects. Don't use the package option, as it
is still work in progress.

For a quick start using Ubuntu version >= 14.04, run
```
sudo curl -L http://raw.github.com/opencog/ocpkg/master/ocpkg -o /usr/local/bin/octool &&\
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/octool &&\
octool
```

For detailed instructions see [here](http://wiki.opencog.org/wikihome/index.php/Building_OpenCog#octool_for_ubuntu)

#### octool-wip
The separate octool script is not yet ready so use the ocpkg's file renamed as octool. See above.

#### ocbootstrap
(This hasn't been tested for a while)
A script to create an OpenCog build environment on ''any'' Linux system.

#### ocfeedbot
An IRC bot of some sort, purpose not clear.

Uses debootstrap. Requires ocpkg.

#### octool_rpi
